This repository holds the contents discussed in the research discussed in:  

Samuel Lobert, Anik Baul and Dr. Ahmed Abdelgawad, “Replication and Advancement of a Functional Electronic Stimulation Device: A Practical Guide,” 3rd IEEE International Conference on Computing and Machine Intelligence (ICMI 2024), Mount Pleasant, MI, USA, April 2024. 

 

These files are presented for use in recreating and advancing the discussed PCB and circuit. The authors hope additional research will be conducted which improves the overall efficiency and effectiveness of FES devices for medical applications. The authors only ask that our work be properly cited in the case that any of our findings or files are used in future FES or similar applications. Note, many PCB designs were attempted for this research and the research team decided to include multiple of these designs in this repository for future research to build upon.  

 

If there are an yquestions about the material in this repository, or any questions about how the research team may be able to help in future research, please contact Samuel Lobert at lober1sc@cmich.edu or lobertsa@msu.edu .The research team thanks you for your interest in our work.
